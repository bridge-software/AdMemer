# How does it work?
  In manifest.json we define the content scripts and in which sites it will work. In this example it works on every site on the web!
  "content.js" is the javascript file which we execute. This file basically replaces every element with tag "img" with a placeholder photo. In our case, it is our beloved BBQ master Berkay Ko√ßak!
